## Compacted Userarea

###Description
This Mini-Theme for Discord reduces the Userarea to the top left Corner while keeping *most* of the Functions. You can change your Status by clicking on your name in the Top Bar. You can also easily adjust the colors of the Top Bar, the Serverlist, the Divider and adjust the width of the Statuspicker. This Mini-Theme will most likely not work that well on Operating Systems differing from Windows since i have no Machines to test it on.
