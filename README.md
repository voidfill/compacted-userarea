### Description
This Mini-Theme for Discord reduces the Userarea to the top left Corner while keeping *most* of the Functions. You can change your Status by clicking on your name in the Top Bar. This Theme will most likely not work that well on Operating Systems differing from Windows since i have no Machines to test it on.

### Variables to adjust
You can adjust 5 values in the Theme by changing the Variables in the _index.scss File: The Top Bar Background, Serverlist Background, Dividerexistance, as well as the Statuspickwerwidth. The most sensible Configuration would be to have its width the same as the Channellist, but you can choose to reduce it so as to retain more of the Topbar Useability.

### Important Changes
I have moved the Statuspicker to the very Top and you can access it by clicking on your Name/Status. Furthermore, the Profile Picture will now be the Home Button. Sadly i didnt find any good area to put the 'click to copy Username' thing so it had to go.

### Installation
So far this Theme only works on [Powercord](https://github.com/powercord-org/powercord) and Vizality, but i plan on making it work on most others soon:tm:

Vizality: 

```cd vizality/addons/themes && git clone https://github.com/voidfill/compacted-userarea```

Powercord:

```cd powercord/src/powercord/themes && git clone https://github.com/voidfill/compacted-userarea```
